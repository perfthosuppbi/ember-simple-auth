## Who is Jovanotti?
 
Jovanotti, whose real name is Lorenzo Cherubini, is one of the most popular and influential Italian artists of his generation. He was born in Rome on September 17, 1966, but he spent part of his childhood and adolescence in Cortona, a small town in Tuscany. He started his career as a DJ of dance and hip-hop music in the mid-1980s, and soon caught the attention of Claudio Cecchetto, a famous producer and radio personality who invited him to move to Milan and work for Radio DeeJay.

In 1988, he released his debut album, *Jovanotti for President*, which introduced him to the Italian public as a cheerful and energetic rapper who sang about love, parties, and social issues. His stage name, Jovanotti, was a misspelling of giovanotti, which means \"young people\" in Italian. He quickly became a symbol of the youth culture of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and his songs were often used as soundtracks for TV shows and commercials. [^1^] [^3^]
 
However, Jovanotti was not satisfied with being labeled as a novelty act or a teen idol. He wanted to explore different musical genres and express his artistic vision more freely. He began to collaborate with various musicians and producers, such as Franco Battiato , Lucio Dalla , Pino Daniele , Eros Ramazzotti , and others. He also traveled around the world, especially to Africa and Latin America, where he discovered new sounds and rhythms that influenced his style. He incorporated elements of funk, rock, reggae, folk, world music, and even classical music into his songs, creating a unique blend that defied categorization. [^1^] [^2^]
 
## What are some of his achievements?
 
Jovanotti has released 15 studio albums, six live albums, four compilation albums, and over 40 singles. He has sold more than 10 million records worldwide and has won numerous awards, including four Festivalbar , three MTV Europe Music Awards , two World Music Awards , two Wind Music Awards , and one David di Donatello . He has also performed in some of the most prestigious venues in Italy and abroad, such as the San Siro Stadium in Milan, the Olympic Stadium in Rome, the Madison Square Garden in New York, the Royal Albert Hall in London, and the Colosseum in Rome.

Besides his musical career, Jovanotti has also been involved in other artistic fields. He has written books of poetry and essays, such as *Io e Te* (Me and You) and *Il Grande Boh!* (The Big Boh!). He has appeared in several movies and TV shows, such as *Da grande* (When I Grow Up), *Tutti gli uomini del deficiente* (All the Men of the Idiot), *L'isola dei famosi* (The Island of the Famous), and *X Factor*. He has also directed documentaries and music videos for himself and other artists. [^1^] [^3^]
 
Moreover, Jovanotti has been an active supporter of various social causes and humanitarian organizations. He has participated in campaigns for Amnesty International , Greenpeace , Emergency , Make Poverty History , Save the Children , Oxfam , Unicef , and others. He has also organized concerts and events to raise awareness and funds for issues such as AIDS , war victims , environmental protection , human rights , education , peace , and justice . [^1^] [^2^]

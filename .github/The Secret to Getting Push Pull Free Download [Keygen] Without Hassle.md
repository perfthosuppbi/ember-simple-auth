- **If you want to duplicate the extrusion on a different face of your model,** you can double-click on that face with the push/pull tool. This will create an extrusion that matches the length and direction of the previous one.
- **If you want to stack an identical extrusion on top of the existing one,** you can hold down Ctrl (Microsoft Windows) or Option (macOS) and then double-click on the same face with the push/pull tool. This will create an extrusion that is parallel and adjacent to the previous one.
